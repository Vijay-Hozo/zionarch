    "description": "This multi-storey residence is envisioned as a refined urban response, defined by layered volumes and a strong material presence. The architectural composition employs recessed balconies and framed openings to establish depth and proportional balance. A combination of textured surfaces, warm-toned cladding, and neutral finishes lends the façade a composed yet distinctive character. Integrated planter zones and screened terraces contribute to environmental comfort and visual softness. The design emphasizes spatial efficiency, privacy control, and clear structural articulation across all levels. Openings are calibrated to optimize daylight penetration while maintaining a controlled external interface. The project demonstrates a contemporary residential approach aligned with contextual sensitivity and functional elegance."

    "description": "A three-storey residence that showcases a refined interplay of clean lines, bold geometric volumes, and warm material palettes. The façade articulates cantilevered frames, horizontal bands, and recessed balconies to create depth, shade, and visual balance. A combination of textured finishes, wood-toned cladding, and large glazed openings enhances both thermal comfort and natural daylight penetration. The integrated car porch, corner fenestrations, and carefully proportioned voids optimise functionality on a compact urban plot. The rooftop terrace with pergola detailing extends the living experience outdoors, offering a private leisure deck within the city fabric. Thoughtful landscape pockets and a sleek boundary treatment complete the modern architectural expression of this residence."
